								<p>My name is Michael Nana Yaw Ansah. My primary interest now is to reveal the Resurrected Christ in Power. I studied and practiced Architecture before moving to Germany for 7 years to obtain a Master's degree and work a bit. In May 2025, the Lord made it clear to me that it was time to give myself wholly to the mandate of Adullam which he showed me 10 years ago. I enjoy creating and performing music. The piano has been my friend since 2nd grade. If you want to be equipped in bearing witness to the Resurrected Christ with Power I would be happy to connect! </p>
