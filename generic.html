								<p>My name is Michael Nana Yaw Ansah. My primary interest now is to reveal the Resurrected Christ in Power. I first had my Jesus encounter when I was 16. At that age, all else became meaningless except to pursue Him, manifest Him and train others to be like Him in their unique ways. I have spent the last 16 years being trained by the Lord for this one purpose. During this training period, I have also studied Architecture in Ghana, obtained a Master's in Entrepreneurship in Germany, worked for Facebook as a Technical Implementation Specialist, all while serving in diverse churches and Christian groups, some of which I founded. In May 2025, the Lord made it clear to me that it was time to give myself wholly to the mandate of Adullam, which he showed me 10 years ago. I enjoy creating and performing music. The piano has been my friend since the 2nd grade. If you want to be equipped in bearing witness to the Resurrected Christ with Power I would be happy to connect! </p>
